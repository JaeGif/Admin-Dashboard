# Admin-Dashboard
This project is my first exposure to using CSS Grid as a layout tool. The page is not meant to be responsive or even exceptionally interactable, just to follow a good layout schema and use both Grid and Flexbox appropriately. There will be some minor interactivity added for flair and spice. 

The button animations are free to use courtesy of eludadev at https://github.com/uihaven/ui-buttons with minor tweaks to fit the theme of this page.
